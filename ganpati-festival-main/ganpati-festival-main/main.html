		   <h2>History</h2>
				 <p>To celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi, devotees bring home idols of Lord Ganesh to worship the deity, eat good food, enjoy with friends and family, and in the end, immerse the idols. Additionally, temples offer prayers and distribute sweets such as modaks because it is Lord Ganesh's favourite. The festival marks the birth of Lord Ganesh, the god of wisdom and prosperity. It falls in the Bhadrapada month of the Hindu calendar, which falls in August-September.
					Lord Ganesh is considered a symbol of wisdom, writing, travel, commerce and good fortune. He is also called Gajanana, Gajadanta, and Vighnaharta. These are few names among his 108 other titles.The Indian mythology tells the legend of Goddess Parvati creating baby Lord Ganesh using sandalwood paste and asking him to guard the entrance while she took a bath. When Lord Shiva arrived at the entrance and told Ganesh that he wanted to visit Goddess Parvati, Ganesh refused to allow him to pass through. This made Lord Shiva angry and enraged he severed the child's head. When Goddess Parvati realised what had happened, she was heartbroken.
				  Seeing Goddess Parvati overwhelmed with grief, Lord Shiva promised to bring baby Ganesh back to life. He instructed his followers to search for the head of the first living creature they could find. However, they could only find a baby elephant's head. That is how Lord Ganesha came back to life with the head of an elephant

		   <h2>GANPATI DHOL</h2>
				<p> 
					The whole of Maharashtra reverberates with a resonance during Ganesh Festival and specially on the 10th day of the festival, Anant Chaturdashi.  The resonance is of ‘Dhol-Tasha’. Basically, a combination of percussion instruments, ‘Dhol-Tasha’ were primarily used at the beginning of war, to motivate soldiers and the dance performed on it is done with spears (Barchi chi nrutya). This however, was canonised in civilian life in mid-sixties in the cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune. 
					As a city Pune is vibrant during Ganesh festivals and the troupes performing ‘Dhol-Tasha’ or popularly known as Dhol-Tasha Pathaks are nothing short of tourist attraction. This incorporation in Ganesh festival was a revolution in itself. The legend goes, that in early sixties, there were riots during Ganesh festival, due to which there were prohibitions of instrument usage. Citing the dull atmosphere during the festivals, Dr Vishvanath Vinayak Pendse or known as Dr Appasaheb Pendse, a visionary educationist and chief of one of the most respected education institutes in Pune-Dnyanprabodhini, himself got playing the instruments in the middle of Laxmi Raod-hub during Ganesh festivals. And since then, the Dhol-Tasha culture became a part of Ganesh festival. Today, two months prior to Ananth Charturdashi, many youngsters participate in Dhol Tasha Pathaks to play on that day.The Dhol-Tasha and Lezim are a part of every village fair or what is called as Jatra in the Maval region of Maharashtra, once a bastion for army. This peculiar form and a combination of some sounds in slightly urban lifestyle, formed what is known today as Mavali Dhol. Then there is Nashik Dhol (Freestyle) and slowly the forms are adapting to much more urbane sounds. However, the purists will swear by the original sounds, one that will be preferred over the inappropriate songs played during the festivals. The performances are set to rhythmic patterns that start slow and reach a crescendo that can take the listeners to a frenzy.
				The dhol has leather coating with bamboo sticks to play with, it also has a prelude of Tasha and a clarion and shiv garjana or war-calling.  There are certainly some changes that have taken place with time. Previously, cane sticks were used to play the tasha but now even fibre sticks are used to play Tasha. Also, the players would tie the dhol around their necks and play but now many tie it around
		   <br><br>It also helps the state governments to  implement new environmental policies and enforce them to build a better eco system. Many NGOs will be encouraged to use new dynamic models that changes from a small area pollution to all over the nation.

		   <h2>GANPATI LEZIM</h2>
				<p> Lezim (लेझिम) or lazium is a folk dance form, from the state of Maharashtra in India.

					Sometimes also spelt as "Lezium", Lezim dancers carry a small musical instrument with jingling cymbals called the Lezim or lezium, after which the dance form is named. There are minimum 20 dancers in lezim. This dance is named after a wooden idiophone to which thin metal discs are fitted which produce a jingling sound and the dancers use this while classical dancing. Dholki, a drum instrument is used as the main percussion music. It is performed dressed in colourful costumes. The dance is frequently used as a fitness drill by schools in Maharashtra, militias and other institutions because it involves many calisthenic moves and can be quite strenuous.[3]
					Lezim is more of a vigorous physical exercise and drill than a dance; the formations can be in two's, fours and even in a circle. Historically, there were a few variations of the lezim practiced in the villages of Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat, however these are seldom used today. One variation used a 2.5 feet long bamboo pole (Reedh) with an iron chain (Dhanusyasarakhi). This was used more as a form of exercise than dance, as the lezim was heavy. Such lezims were invariably hand made.
					Another variation of the lezim (called Koyande) used a wooden pole, 15 to 18 inches long, with both ends punctured and an iron linked chain weighing about 1 kg running through it scale iron chain link chain. They also contained a 6 inches long hand chain (salaisakhali), through which the four fingers fit snugly.
					The rural form of the dance usually consists of lezim dancers in two rows, repeating a sequence of steps, changing the steps every few beats. Thus, a 5-minute lezim performance can consist of 25 different steps danced in unison.
					Other variations include dancing the lezim in four rows, in a single circle formation (Nartakasamuhanni), or in concentric circles formations (samuhanrtyanta nartakam)(similar to the garbha dance), with each dancer twirling and dancers of opposite rows often playing lezim with each other. Changes in steps are "announced" by a ring leader using a whistle.
					Lezim is especially popular in rural Maharashtra, often played during the Ganesh festival (गणेशोत्सव), in village Jatras (religious processions) and in schools as part of the fitness regime.
					There are three main types of Lezim - military lezim (popular in Baroda and mostly used as a martial art for defense), talathekya and samanyajananna. The first lezim performance to an international audience was presented at the ninth Asian Games (1982, Delhi) where 400 of the best Maharashtrian lezim players gave a demonstration .
					The local names of the components of the Lezim dance are Lezim - approximately one-half inch of wood pole (todanna bandhaleli) and a chain called adakavalelya. Striking the chains causes a cymbal like sound 2. halagi - a carmavadya 3. drum - a narrow drum. 4 cymbals - talasarakhe but larger and with a musical pasarata mouth.<br>
